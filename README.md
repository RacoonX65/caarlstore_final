## 📊 Database Schema

The application uses the following Supabase tables:

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `profiles` | User profiles with admin flags |
| `products` | Product catalog with images, pricing, and inventory |
| `cart_items` | Shopping cart items linked to users |
| `orders` | Order records with status and totals |
| `order_items` | Individual items within orders |
| `addresses` | User delivery addresses |
| `reviews` | Product reviews and ratings |
| `discount_codes` | Promotional discount codes |
| `discount_usage` | Tracking of discount code usage |
| `wishlist` | User saved products |

All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled for data protection.

## 👨‍💼 Admin Setup

To access the admin dashboard:

1. **Create an account** on the website
2. **Update the database** to grant admin access:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor → profiles
   - Find your user record
   - Set `is_admin = true`
3. **Access admin dashboard** at `/admin`

Admin routes are protected by middleware that checks the `is_admin` flag.

## 💳 Payment Flow

The application uses Paystack for payment processing:

1. **Cart → Checkout** - User proceeds to checkout with items in cart
2. **Order Creation** - Order is created with "pending" status
3. **Payment Initialization** - Paystack payment is initialized via API
4. **Paystack Redirect** - User is redirected to Paystack payment page
5. **Payment Processing** - User completes payment on Paystack
6. **Verification** - Payment is verified via Paystack API
7. **Order Update** - Order status is updated to "confirmed"
8. **Email Notification** - Confirmation email is sent to customer
9. **Cart Cleared** - Shopping cart is emptied
10. **Success Page** - User sees order confirmation

## 📧 Email Notifications

The app sends automated emails using Resend:

- **Order Confirmation** - Sent when order is placed successfully
- **Order Status Updates** - Sent when admin updates order status
- **Welcome Email** - Sent on account creation (optional)

Email templates are HTML-formatted with Caarl branding and include order details, customer information, and next steps.

## 💬 WhatsApp Integration

Instead of using an expensive WhatsApp API, the app provides a manual messaging system:

1. **Admin Order View** - Click "Message Customer" button
2. **WhatsApp Web** - Opens WhatsApp Web with pre-formatted message
3. **Copy Message** - Or copy the message to send manually

Messages include order details and customer information. Use the business WhatsApp number (063 400 9626) for customer communications.

### Payment Verification Fails

Ensure:
- Paystack secret key is correct
- Using test keys for development, live keys for production
- Order exists in database before payment
- Webhook URL is configured (for production)

### Email Not Sending

Verify:
- Resend API key is valid
- Sender email is verified in Resend dashboard
- Email templates are properly formatted
- RESEND_API_KEY is set in environment variables

### Image Upload Issues

Check that:
- Cloudinary credentials are correct in `.env.local`
- Upload preset is set to "Unsigned"
- Widget is properly initialized in the admin dashboard
- Cloud name and upload preset match your Cloudinary account

### Google Sign-In Not Working

Ensure:
