# Product Image Upload Guide

## Overview
This guide provides instructions for properly uploading product images to ensure optimal display across all devices and screen sizes.

## Image Requirements

### Recommended Specifications
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Minimum Resolution**: 800x800 pixels
- **Maximum File Size**: 5MB per image
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square (1:1) or product-focused rectangular
- **Quality**: High resolution for zoom functionality

### Image Composition Guidelines
1. **Center the Product**: Ensure the main product is centered in the frame
2. **Adequate Padding**: Leave some space around the product edges
3. **Clean Background**: Use white or neutral backgrounds for consistency
4. **Good Lighting**: Ensure even lighting without harsh shadows
5. **Multiple Angles**: Include front, back, side, and detail shots

## Upload Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Images
1. Edit images to meet the specifications above
2. Name files descriptively (e.g., "product-name-front.jpg")
3. Organize images in order of importance

### Step 2: Upload Images
1. Navigate to the product creation/edit page
2. Click the "Upload Images" area or drag and drop files
3. **Preview Feature**: Images will show a preview immediately after selection
4. Wait for the "Uploading..." indicator to complete
5. The first image uploaded becomes the main product image

### Step 3: Verify Upload
1. Check that all images display correctly
2. Ensure the main image represents the product well
3. Verify images are not cropped inappropriately
4. Test on mobile devices to confirm responsive display

## Mobile Considerations

### Touch-Friendly Interface
- All upload areas are optimized for touch interaction
- Minimum 48x48px touch targets for all buttons
- Drag and drop works on mobile browsers that support it

### Image Display
- Images automatically scale to fit mobile screens
- Aspect ratios are preserved to prevent distortion
- Zoom functionality available on mobile through pinch gestures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Images appear cropped or zoomed:**
- Ensure images have adequate padding around the product
- Use square aspect ratios when possible
- Avoid placing important details at image edges

**Upload fails:**
- Check file size (must be under 5MB)
- Verify file format is supported (JPG, PNG, WebP)
- Ensure stable internet connection

**Images look blurry:**
- Use higher resolution source images
- Avoid over-compression when saving images
- Ensure images are at least 800x800 pixels

### Mobile-Specific Issues

**Touch interactions not working:**
- Ensure you're using a supported mobile browser
- Try refreshing the page
- Use the file picker button if drag-and-drop isn't working

**Images not displaying properly on mobile:**
- Clear browser cache
- Check internet connection
- Try uploading smaller file sizes

## Best Practices

1. **Image Order**: Upload your best/main image first
2. **Consistent Style**: Maintain consistent lighting and background across all product images
3. **Multiple Views**: Include at least 3-4 different angles of the product
4. **Detail Shots**: Add close-up images of important features or textures
5. **Context Images**: Consider lifestyle or in-use images to show scale

## Technical Notes

### Image Processing
- Images are automatically optimized for web delivery
- Multiple sizes are generated for different screen resolutions
- Original aspect ratios are preserved during processing

### Browser Compatibility

- Mobile browsers on iOS and Android are fully supported
- Progressive enhancement ensures basic functionality on older browsers
